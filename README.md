# AndroidAppSurvey
I have created an Android Application that will gather user input and give them a result regardimg their diabete risk.
Project has 2 users one for patients and the second for admin.
Patients answer the questions regarding their diabete risk and get their results.
Admin Can display all the information such as number of patients from each gender and age group.
